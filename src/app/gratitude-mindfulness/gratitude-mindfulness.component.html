        <span class="highlight">Mindfulness involves being fully attentive to the present,</span> a state that gratitude can greatly enhance. Acknowledging blessings and acts of kindness grounds us in the now, enriching our practice of mindfulness. By focusing on gratitude, we engage more deeply with the present moment and cultivate a sense of peace and contentment.
