        <span class="highlight">Grieving the loss of a loved one is a unique and personal journey</span> without a right or wrong approach. Support from others, whether through conversations with friends or joining a grief support group, is important. Healing takes time, and it's normal for emotions to ebb and flow. Be patient with yourself through the ups and downs of mourning.
