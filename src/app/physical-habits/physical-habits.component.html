Prioritize nutrition, engage in physical activity, and ensure you get regular sleep to maintain both mental and physical health. Carve out time daily for activities you love, which can uplift your spirits. Regular exercise, such as a daily 30-minute walk, is effective for boosting mood and reducing stress. Reflect on life's purpose and let your values guide your lifestyle choices.
